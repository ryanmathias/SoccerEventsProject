Please also not that the directories with the json data need to be in this directory as well
for this populator to work as it scans through them to find the correct files.

For example:

open-data-0067cae166a56aa80b2ef18f61e16158d6a7359a\open-data-0067cae166a56aa80b2ef18f61e16158d6a7359a\data\events\\

and 

open-data-0067cae166a56aa80b2ef18f61e16158d6a7359a\open-data-0067cae166a56aa80b2ef18f61e16158d6a7359a\data\lineups\\
